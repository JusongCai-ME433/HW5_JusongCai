# HW5_JusongCai

In this homework, I will build the MCP23008 I/O expander circuit and write a library to communicate with it. Initialize pins GP0-3 as outputs, initially on, and GP4-7 as inputs. Build an LED circuit on pin GP0 and a pushbutton circuit on pin GP7. Files will include codes and compile folder, circuit diagram drawing, and demo video.
