# HW5_JusongCai

In this homework, I will build the MCP23008 I/O expander circuit and write a library to communicate with it. Initialize pins GP0-3 as outputs, initially on, and GP4-7 as inputs. Build an LED circuit on pin GP0 and a pushbutton circuit on pin GP7. Files will include codes and compile folder, circuit diagram drawing, and demo video.

As for MCP23008 data sheet and I2C data sheet, they are not included in this folder. But you can google them at microchip official website.
